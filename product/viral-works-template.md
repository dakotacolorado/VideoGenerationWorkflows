**Complete LLM Prompt:**

**1. Base Scene Metadata**

**Scene Type & Location:** A sun-kissed piazza in a quaint Italian hill town, inspired by Eat Pray Love. The focal character — a young woman from New York City — is sitting on a weathered wooden bench at the edge of the square, gazing toward the center. She's surrounded by the slow rhythm of everyday Italian life.

**Style:** Semi-realistic cinematic style with warm, romantic color grading. Soft focus on the foreground, with distant movement slightly blurred for depth. The image feels like it could be a still frame from a European travel film.

**Time of Day:** Late afternoon, around 4:30 pm, when the sun hangs low enough to warm the stone but still lights the whole square.

**Season & Weather:** Early spring, pleasantly mild. The air smells faintly of espresso and baked pastries from a nearby café. Purple wisteria blossoms sway gently on a vine-covered wall, hinting at the season's arrival.

**Key Objects / Props:**
• Pebblestone streets: uneven, smoothed over by centuries of footsteps, in soft beige and terracotta tones
• Stone fountain: centerpiece of the piazza, carved with an elegant cherub figure pouring water from an urn; sunlight glints on the ripples
• Outdoor café seating: wrought iron chairs and small marble-topped tables, with linen napkins fluttering in the breeze
• Flowering vines: purple wisteria climbing up one weathered stucco wall, next to a shuttered window with peeling turquoise paint
• Bicycles: a pair leaning against the side of a building, baskets filled with groceries — bread, fresh herbs, and lemons
• Buildings: warm-toned plaster façades in ochre and salmon, with rust-streaked drainpipes and faded painted shop signs
• Street vendor cart: a small gelato cart with pastel-colored ice cream tubs, shaded by a striped canopy
• Locals & tourists: locals in casual spring clothes carrying grocery bags, tourists holding cameras or sipping Aperol spritz

**Camera Framing & Motion:** Static wide shot from the bench area, framing the fountain slightly off-center. Café seating and flower-covered wall in the background, people moving naturally through the scene. Very subtle handheld sway to mimic a person observing while seated.

**Lighting & Color Palette:** Golden sunlight bathes the square, casting long shadows that stretch across the cobblestones.
• Colors: warm ochre and terracotta, muted teal shutters, soft lavender from the wisteria, creamy whites of café linens, and the deep ruby red of wine glasses catching the light
